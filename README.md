After choosing the difficulty of the gameplay now you can enjoy the game by cutting the fruits and challenge your friends with the score as every game your score is compared with the high score saved on your pc.
The score is based on the number of fruits you cut, as every fruit you cut increase your score +20.

at the beginning of the game you have 3 hearts only if you cut a bomb you lose 1 heart if you missed a fruit you lose a heart and if you lost all your hearts you lose. but there is a special bomb which you cut and lose the game once you cut it so it make the game more challenging and there is also a special fruit that give you an extra heart you can cut those rare fruits more and more to get more hearts and be immortal but take care if you cut a the special bomb you will lose so you should be more sensitive.
